* Target cohort (T)
* Outcome cohort (O)
* Time at risk (TAR)

## Settings

\
\

* *Database details*: The connection details to the database.
* *Population*: Further restrictions on our dataset.
* *Split*: The settings for the split (train/test).

## Settings

\
\

* *Restrict*: Mostly temporal restrictions.
* *Sample*: Settings for sampling from the train set.
* *Feature engineering*: Settings for modifying covariates.

## Settings

\
\

* *Covariates*: Covariates to be considered.
* *Model*: Settings for the model(s) to be trained.

## Performance evaluation

Assume data $(x_i,y_i), i=1\dots n$ and predictions $\hat{p}_i$, then discrimination is
$$
P(y_i>y_j|\hat{p}_i>\hat{p}_j)
$$

for any two patients $i$ and $j$.
