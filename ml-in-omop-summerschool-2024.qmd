## Problem

\
\

> For patients hospitalized with pneumonia, what is their probability of death
> within the next 60 days?

## Cohort definition

\

*Cohort* is a set of patients that fulfill a prespecified set of criteria for a duration of time.

\

## Prediction setting

* Target cohort (T)
* Outcome cohort (O)
* Time at risk (TAR)

## Settings

\
\

* *Database details*: The connection details to the database.
* *Population*: Further restrictions on our dataset.
* *Split*: The settings for the split (train/test).

## Settings

\
\

* *Restrict*: Mostly temporal restrictions.
* *Sample*: Settings for sampling from the train set.
* *Feature engineering*: Settings for modifying covariates.

## Settings

\
\

* *Covariates*: Covariates to be considered.
* *Model*: Settings for the model(s) to be trained.

## Performance evaluation

\

> **Discrimination**
>
> How well can the model separate lower risk from higher risk patients?

## Performance evaluation

\


> **Calibration**
>
> The agreement between observed and estimated probabilities of the
> occurence of the event or outcome.
